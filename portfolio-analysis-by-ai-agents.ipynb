       "'Portfolio Analysis by AI Agents\\n\\nAuthor: Anuj Vishwakarma\\nTrack: AI Agents / Automated Decision-Making Systems\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nManaging an investment portfolio requires continuous tracking, evaluation, and decision-making. However, for working professionals, especially those with long and demanding schedules, maintaining a disciplined monitoring routine becomes almost impossible. With markets moving quickly and investment decisions depending on real-time data, missing signals—even for a day—can impact returns significantly.\\nThe project “Portfolio Analysis by AI Agents” solves this problem by building a fully automated, multi-agent system that acts as a personal investment researcher. By combining automated data extraction, intelligent analytics, contextual reasoning, and AI-generated recommendations, the system provides a complete, hands-free portfolio management experience.\\nThis capstone demonstrates how AI agents can independently gather information, analyze market conditions, and produce actionable insights similar to what a financial analyst would deliver—within seconds, using only a single notebook cell. The project showcases multi-agent orchestration, tool-based automation, contextual memory, and real-world workflow design, aligning strongly with the goals of the Google × Kaggle AI Agents program.\\n\\n2. Problem Statement\\n\\nMany retail investors struggle to consistently monitor their portfolios. A typical example is a full-time working professional whose day runs from 10 AM to 10 PM—during the very hours when the stock market is active. This leads to multiple challenges:\\nInability to monitor price fluctuations or intraday volatility\\nNo time to track technical indicators such as RSI, MACD, or moving averages\\nDifficulty reviewing fundamentals (PE, PB, ROE, ROCE) for long-term evaluation\\nMissing important news that may impact stock performance\\nReliance on rushed or incomplete research leading to poor decision-making\\nLack of consistent, data-backed strategy and insights\\nManually checking apps like Zerodha or Groww, reading charts, refreshing indicators, and scanning financial news daily is unrealistic. As a result, crucial opportunities are missed, risks go unnoticed, and portfolio performance suffers.\\n\\nThe core question becomes:\\n“How can an investor with no time efficiently manage their portfolio, track trends, and make informed decisions?”\\nThis project answers that question by building an autonomous, agent-driven investment assistant.\\n\\n3. Project Solution Overview\\n\\nThe solution is an end-to-end automated Portfolio Analysis Agent System powered by multiple AI agents, structured to perform independently yet collaboratively. The system does the work of a financial analyst, data researcher, and market scanner—without requiring user intervention.\\n\\nWith a single click, the agents perform the following steps:\\n\\nSecure login to MCP-enabled broker systems (like Zerodha MCP)\\nFetch current portfolio holdings and live market prices\\nCollect historical OHLC data for all stocks\\nCompute technical indicators including:\\nRSI (Relative Strength Index)\\nMACD\\nSMA 20/50/200\\nTrend direction and strength\\nScrape fundamental metrics such as:\\nPE Ratio\\nPB Ratio\\nROE, ROCE\\nMarket cap & earnings trends\\nPull latest news & sentiment signals using Google Search\\nRun all insights through a Portfolio Report Agent\\n\\nGenerate:\\n\\nBUY/HOLD/SELL decisions\\nEntry points, stop-loss levels, and target ranges\\nRisk warnings\\nConsolidated summary sheet\\nRanked scoring of portfolio health\\n\\nAll of this is achieved with minimal user interaction. The system is designed to behave like a personal research assistant, working automatically in the background.\\n\\n4. Value Proposition\\n\\nThe project delivers strong value to investors—especially busy professionals—by providing:\\n\\na. Hands-Free Portfolio Management\\nThe entire research process is automated. No need to manually log in, track charts, or search news.\\n\\nb. Faster and More Consistent Decisions\\nAI agents process structured workflows consistently every time, avoiding human errors or emotional bias.\\n\\nc. Daily/Weekly Investment Briefing Reports\\nThe system generates insights and summaries instantly, replacing hours of manual research.\\n\\nd. Actionable Trading Recommendations\\nOutputs are not vague insights—they include precise decisions:\\nBUY/HOLD/SELL\\nEntry ranges\\nStop-loss levels\\nTarget projections\\n\\ne. Agent-Assisted Reasoning\\nThe advisor agent cross-references:\\ntechnical indicators\\nfundamentals\\nnews sentiment\\nprice patterns\\nto deliver expert-level actionable strategies.\\nOverall, the project transforms how an everyday investor can analyze and respond to market conditions using AI agents.\\n\\n5. System Architecture\\n\\nThe multi-agent architecture is structured into four specialized agents, each performing a well-defined task:\\n\\na. Portfolio Intake Agent\\nReads asset list from the user or broker system\\nValidates ticker symbols and structure\\nConverts data into a structured dataframe / JSON\\nInitiates the analysis workflow\\nThis agent ensures the pipeline receives clean and well-formatted data.\\n\\nb. Market Data Agent\\nFetches live prices via MCP or external APIs\\nPulls OHLC (Open-High-Low-Close) historical data\\nComputes daily returns, volatility, and trends\\nCalculates:\\nCurrent value\\nPortfolio weight\\nUnrealized P&L\\nIt acts as the \"data aggregator\" agent.\\n\\nc. Analytics Agent\\nRuns the core calculations:\\nRSI, MACD, SMA20/50/200\\nTrend classification (uptrend, downtrend, sideways)\\nSupport/resistance detection\\nFundamental metrics scraping\\nDiversification score\\nPortfolio risk level\\nIdentifies:\\ntop gainers\\ntop losers\\noverweight/underweight sectors\\nThis agent extracts the signals needed for trading decisions.\\n\\nd. Advisor Agent (LLM-powered)\\nThis is the decision-making brain.\\nIt uses LLM reasoning to produce:\\nStock-wise actionable decisions\\nPortfolio risk assessment\\nSuggested rebalancing strategies\\nTrade plans (entry, stop-loss, target)\\nWarnings about news or volatility\\nConsolidated summary for the entire portfolio\\nThe Advisor Agent transforms raw analysis into human-centric investment guidance.\\n\\n6. Agent Orchestration Flow\\n\\nThe workflow of the system operates sequentially and intelligently:\\nUser → Portfolio Intake Agent \\n     → Market Data Agent \\n     → Analytics Agent \\n     → Advisor Agent \\n     → Final Portfolio Report\\nEach agent passes tools, memory, and structured context forward. This makes the entire system modular, scalable, and easy to debug.\\n\\n7. Tools & Techniques Demonstrated\\n\\nThis project demonstrates multiple key concepts from the Google × Kaggle AI Agents course:\\n\\n✔ Multi-Agent Collaboration\\nSequential and functional division of work using specialized agents.\\n\\n✔ MCP Tools\\nIntegration with:\\nZerodha MCP for secure holdings\\nCustom data-fetching tools\\nGoogle Search for news analysis\\n\\n✔ Sessions & Memory\\nInMemorySessionService\\nAgent-level state tracking\\nContext-aware report generation\\n\\n✔ Observability & Logging\\nADK LoggingPlugin\\nCustom observability plugin\\nPython logging for tracking\\nStep-by-step agent traces\\n\\n✔ Context Engineering\\nWell-structured JSON passed between agents ensures predictable outputs.\\nOverall, the project is an excellent showcase of practical AI agent development.\\n\\n8. Notebook Structure\\n\\nNotebook is organized into logical sections aligned with the agent architecture:\\n\\na. Setup & Dependencies\\nLoad libraries\\nConfigure logging\\nInitialize tools\\n\\nb. Observability Layer\\nLogging Plugin\\nCustom event tracker\\n\\nc. MCP Agent Integration\\nLogin to Zerodha MCP\\nFetch holdings\\nLTP (Live Trading Price) functions\\n\\nd. Analytics Pipeline\\nOHLC data extraction\\nTechnical indicator calculations\\nFundamentals scraping\\n\\ne. Portfolio Report Agent\\nGoogle Search news pipeline\\nLLM analysis\\nRecommendation formatting\\n\\nf. Final Execution Cell\\nSingle click run pipeline\\nFinal report displayed\\n\\nThis structure emphasizes clarity, reproducibility, and modularity.\\n\\n9. Process Flow Summary\\n\\nThe entire workflow follows this logic:\\nUser triggers analysis\\nSystem retrieves holdings via MCP\\nMarket data is fetched and enriched\\nTechnical + fundamental analytics run\\nNews & sentiment collected\\nAdvisor Agent synthesizes insights\\nFinal portfolio report is generated\\nThe output is a clear, easy-to-read trading dashboard.\\n\\n10. Conclusion\\n\\nThe \"Portfolio Analysis by AI Agents\" project demonstrates how AI can transform traditional investment research into an automated, intelligent, and time-efficient process. For investors with busy schedules, this system behaves like a full-time research assistant—tracking data, analyzing trends, monitoring risk, and generating actionable advice.\\nBy leveraging multi-agent orchestration, MCP tools, observability frameworks, and LLM-driven decision-making, this project provides a real-world, production-ready application of AI agents in finance. Its modular design, clean workflow, and practical relevance make it not only a strong capstone submission but also a foundation for future enhancements such as automated alerts, WhatsApp reports, strategy backtesting, or deployment on cloud platforms.\\nThis capstone showcases the power of AI agents in solving complex, time-sensitive tasks—and represents a meaningful contribution to modern portfolio management powered by intelligent automation.'"
